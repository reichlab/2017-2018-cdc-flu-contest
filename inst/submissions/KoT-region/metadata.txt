  Weighted ensemble of 3 models fit to past ILINet data, with model weights changing over the season: (1) kernel density estimation (for seasonal targets) or a simple seasonal spline model (for weekly incidence targets); (2) kernel conditional density estimation with copulas; and (3) a seasonal ARIMA model.
